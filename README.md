This is the next gen Edison Desktop, I promise you'll see one of these on the offical website some day

- Login via a Android phone using the Edison app

Features missing:
- Cards adding, sharing, editing, attaching and deleting
- Pages editing
- Courses page

## Requirements
- A Web server i.e. apache (I recommend installing apache, note that PhpStorm comes pre-installed with a web-server, so you wouln't need to install for development purposes)
